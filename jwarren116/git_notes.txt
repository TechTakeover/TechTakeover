git checkout -b <new branch name>: create and switch to new branch in one command.
git stash: stashes current uncommited work so you can checkout another branch (or something that would lose the uncommited work) and still return to that work later.

Not entirely from the Git Basics Course, but I recently learned that you cannot push a master branch to a remote master branch that's currently checked out (like with a webserver). You need to push an "update" branch, and then merge them server side!
