I have also learned a lot about unix and its many commands. 


cd —— will take me to my root directory. 

cd .. —— will take me back one in my directory

mkdir dirname —— will make a new directory named dirname

touch filename —— will make a new file named filename

cd Python/ —— will take me one step to the directory named Python

ls ——— will list the files/ folders in the directory I am in. 

ls -la —— will not only list the files/folders, but will do it vertically with full info

mv —— can be used for moving files, but also renaming if you put in mv <filename> <newfilename>

rm —— will remove the file.
