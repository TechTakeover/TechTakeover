I have learned oodles about git. 
For example…..

git add —— Adds the file from workspace to the staging area.

git commit -m “”  ——— commits the file in the staging area to the .git directory(repository)

git push —— will push this from the .git repository to github. You can either have your repo address saved in your system. Or you can simply do a ‘git push ‘url of your repo’’ and that will send it to your Repository. At this point you will need to put in your username and password.

git diff will show the changes between the index and tree.

git status will show which files are in the staging area or have been modified and need to be added.
