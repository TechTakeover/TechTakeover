Additional Notes 1

Why Unix?

-more compatible
-most apps use unix


What’s unix?
-it is an operating system
-multi process
-multi user
-released in 1973
-multi platform software
-most popular version (Darwin - used by OS X), (Linux - used by Android)

Most Common Unix traits (Unix Philosophy)
-Data as Plaintext files
-Nested Subdirectories
-many small programs
-input~output redirection (input can come some place other than the keyboard, output can be sent somewhere other than the screen)
Example:
An event history can be sent to the screen for display or saved to a log file.

Unix Kernel
-A program which manages the hardware
-generally safe from hackers

Unix Shell
-A program which provides the user interface for the unix kernel
-the original UI is a command line interpreter
-Modern OS uses a more graphical UI shell
-More modern OS use Multi touch UI shell
-Another is Audible shell (Cortana for windows, Siri for Apple)
-Manages the details on handling of the details between the different apps

UNIX Command Line
A path is absolute when it starts with /
A path is relative when it doesn’t start with a /


Unix Commands
$ ls
shows the list of files in that current directory

$ ls -t
-t flag sorts the files by the most recent modified

$ls -l
show list in long format

$ history
show history of commands executed in terminal

$ history | less
show history of commands executed in terminal with paging options (Enter - one line at a time, space - one screen at a time)

CONCEPT : Piping

The pipe (|) can chain commands as the output of one command and be the input of another command

EXAMPLE: $ history | sort | less

CONCEPT: Saving History into a file (Redirection)
-use the redirection symbol (>) to overwrite into a new or existing file, if no file exists,

- one arrow (>) to create/overwrite, two arrows (>>) to append

$ history > moving_around.txt

COMMAND mv
-can be used to move files from one path to a target path

$ mv <current path> <file name> <target path> <target file name>


git init :initializes a new repository on the current working folder
git add  :adds files to the staging area
