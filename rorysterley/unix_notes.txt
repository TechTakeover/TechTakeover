Unix
##############


General
=======
Multi process
Multi user
Released in 1973
BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution

GNU (Richard Stallman) ... GNU/Linux (Linus Torvalds)
  - Open source

REPL: A Unix shell works like a read-evaluate-print loop or REPL

Helpful commands:
  - which <command>
    -this will tell you where a given command is installed
    Example: $ which brew


Traits  (The Unix Philosophy)
======
Data as plain text files
Nested subdirectories
Many Small Programs
Input-Output Redirection  ( <  > | )


Unix Kernel
===========
Kernel - The base of the OS - A program that manages the system hardware

  User:     | Other Programs
  OS:       | Kernel
  Hardware: | CPU, Memory, Devices...

  Safe from hackers: Require administrative password to update Kernel


Unix Shell
==========
User interface to the Kernel
  - command line interface (Original UI)
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  - Multi-Touch User Interfaces (Fingers...)
  - Audible User Interface (Talk to it)
  (These are all shells)


Terminal
========
Emulator: Terminal is an app that will run your shell


Homebrew
========
Package Manager
Installed at /usr/local
Installs binarys to /usr/local/bin


Command Line
============

Notation formating:
  [some stuff] Optional commands
  <Required Stuff> Required Info


Relative path: Does not begin with a '/'
Absolute path: Starts with '/'

'/' Root: The start of the file system
'~' Home: Shorthand to your home directory
cd <absolute or relative path>  (changes directory)
ls  list what is in the current directory
   -t   lists by time (last modified)
   -h   makes file size human readable
   -r   revers order
   -a   shows hidden files (.)
   -x   prints info horizontally
touch  (updattes time stamp on files and creates them if they don't exist)
In fish:
la = ls -lah     and possibly some more stuff


Note: Escape a space '\ '
    ex: cd ~/My Pics    ERROR: ~/My does not exist
        cd ~/My\ Pics

Case Sensitivity
================

Linux IS case sensitive
OSX & Windows are case insensitive (They are NOT case sensitive)

write all your file names in lowercase and NO spaces


Cutting Corners
===============
use relative directory when navigating
. represents the current directory
.. represents one level up
~ (tilde) shortcut to home
cd (with no arguments or path will shortcut you to home)


PATH
====
Path reads directly to its directorys not to subdirectories
    If /usr/local/bin is in $PATH:
  eg: /usr/local/bin
      /usr/local/bin/testfolder  (will not read rom test folder)

Chain of Commands
=================

| (pipe) Takes the output of command (a) and pipes it to the input of
  command (b).

> overwrite to standard input
    The redirection operator (>) sends the output of the command on the left side tot he input of the command on the right side.
< overwrite to standard output
>> append to end of file via standard input
(These methods can create files if they don't exist)

====================
Searching in the terminal

in a man page type '/'
  this enables search mode. Type your search term and press enter.
  then press 'n' to go to the next instance of your search term.
